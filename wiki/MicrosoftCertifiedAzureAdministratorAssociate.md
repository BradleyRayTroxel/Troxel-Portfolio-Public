## 5 W's

### Who

Created by Bradley Ray John Troxel

### What

A collection of information, advice, and tips for earning the certificate Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate.

### When

I will update this document as needed, but due to the ability to renew my certification without taking the exam, this information is primarily applicable to taking the exam in 2025. As time progresses, the information contained within this markdown file will become stale and less applicable.

### Where

This information is contained within the same file, but I recommend getting primary sources on this information from the following locations.

- [Microsoft Learn's description of the certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification).
- [John Savill's Technical Training](https://youtube.com/@ntfaqguy?si=uMh7zMMXnsqIfTTl).
- [Pearson VUE, the administrator of these exams](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/microsoft.html).

### Why

I have the certification Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate, and have some information on how you can study for the certification and tips for taking the test.

## Study Resources

### Microsoft Learn

Microsoft provides an in depth course for certification that is the perfect place to start when trying to get this certification, [I recommend everyone should start here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification).

As I progressed through the course I used Quizlet to take notes on key topics and terms to help commit the info to memory. It's an effective study technique in my opinion.

### John Savill's Technical Training

John Savill provides a free presentation of the information covered in the exam for this certification. This is his video that I used to pass the exam in 2025, [AZ-104 Administrator Associate Study Cram v2](https://youtu.be/0Knf9nub4-k?si=YxQaOjWlcXnRwfur).

### Legacy Notes And Flashcards

I took some notes when I was studying for the exam in 2022, and they can be found [in the wiki assets](https://github.com/BradleyRayTroxel/Troxel-Portfolio-Public/blob/main/wiki/assets/LegacyJohnSavillCramNotes.md).

Also I created some flash cards in 2022 hosted on the website Quizlet. [Here is a link to that set of flash cards](https://quizlet.com/user/bRad1300/folders/2022-az-104).

## Exam Tips

Here are some tips for purchasing the exam and exam day.

- Try and invest in supporting yourself if you fail your first time. If you purchase a voucher for microsoft exams that has a exam replay, you get an opportunity to take the exam again for free. [Microsoft explains this more here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/deals#exam-replay).
  - I purchased this for $230 USD as opposed to the advertized $165 USD for the exam voucher. Then performed the following steps.
    1. I purchased it through Pearson Vue.
    1. Waited and received a voucher code in my email.
    1. Scheduled the exam starting on the Microsoft website.
    1. Enter the code received from the previous purchase before I enter my payment information for the $165 USD voucher. There should be a field for this near the top of the webpage.
    1. There is now no charge for the exam, and you have the ability to fail and take it again after learning your weak areas.
- Perform self care for yourself the day before and day of the exam. You should know what works best for you.
- Manage your time during the exam.
  - Before the exam starts, you get an explanation of the number of questions and case studies the exam comprises of.
  - You have the ability to access Microsoft Learn during the exam.
    - When I was using Microsoft Learn during the exam, I could not search the webpage for certain words and had to skim the page quickly to find things like RBAC built in roles and actions.
    - This took lot of time during the exam.
    - You theoretically can find a Microsoft Learn reference for nearly every question the exam, but it does not seem possible to do that within the time limit for the exam.
  - Due to the time investment for reviewing Microsoft Learn, I recommend the following.
    - **Dedicate at least 10 or 15 minutes to case studies. Adjust this to the number of studies you need to answer questions for.**
    - **Attempt to complete 10 questions or 20% of the exam without Microsoft Learn.**
    - **Throughout the exam, write down the question number of questions you don't know or feel not confident of the answer on.**
    - **Attempt to have 25 to 30 minutes left before you are told you can not navigate back to previous questions.**
    - **Go back to those questions you noted down to use Microsoft Learn for, and attempt to answer as many as possible correctly, but ensure you do not use too much time and preserve the time for case studies.**
- Answer all questions on the exam, you have a higher chance of passing the exam if you run out of time and answer all questions with the first available answer, than not answering the questions at all.
